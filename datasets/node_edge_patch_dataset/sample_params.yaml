  experiment_name: datasets
  parent_dataset: candidate-grains-toy-lmd-v2.0.0
  dataset_version: 1 # can be used to differentiate re-processing of same parent
  # with different parameters

node_patches:
  # array indices r_min, c_min, r_max, c_max
  # such that img[r_min:rmax, c_min:cmax] can be used to
  #select the grain patch from rolled image (grain in center)
  window: [208, 208, 304, 304]

edge_patches:
  size: 48 # length of square patch with edge centered in image
  width: 2 # pixels within a city block distance of <width> away from the closest
           # pixel in the other grain will be considered as part of the boundary
