Each experiment is run as an mlflow project. The project specification is defined in the MLProject file in each experiment directory. run_experiment.sh provides a convenient way to run a project:

```
bash run_experiment.sh [--cpu] [--env-file=.env] [--param-file=.run_params] /path/to/experiment 
```

Experiments require various environment variables to be defined in a .env file. The
most common ones are described in ./env_template.
