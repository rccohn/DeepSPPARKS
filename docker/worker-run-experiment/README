Each experiment is run as an mlflow project. The project specification is defined in the MLProject file in each experiment directory. run_experiment.sh provides a convenient way to run a project:

```
bash run_experiment.sh [--cpu] [--env-file=.env] /path/to/experiment 
```

Most experiments require various environment variables to be defined in a .env file.
TODO finalize required specifications and update.
