Files for running containerized mlflow experiments.

run_experiment.sh is the file used to:
  - read environment variables (dataset location, ip of mlflow server, etc)
  - start the docker container used to run an experiment
  - copy experiment files into container, mount dataset to container
  - run the experiment

In this context, an experiment is a directory which contains
AT LEAST the following files:
  - .env
  - start.sh

But will most likely have other files as well (such as a python
script to train/evaluate a model)

.env defines environment variables that are used. Some of the variables
are read by run_experiment.sh, and the rest are passed to the container
that is used to run the experiment.

start.sh is the script that will run the experiment. It can be as simple as
"python my_script.py", but provides additional flexibility in case you 
want to incorporate other elements into the experiment.
