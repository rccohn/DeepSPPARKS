# environment variables for mlflow experiments

# ssh folder configured for container use (ie permissions/owner must be configured for user "root", see readme for more info
# needed if mlflow tracking uses a sftp artifact backend
# even if a different backend is used, this should point to an existing folder so that docker does not create an unused
# volume. Mounted as read only so container cannot accidentally alter ssh keys.
CONTAINER_SSH=/home/USER/.ssh

# root directory for datasets (contains each dataset as a subdirectory)
# mounted as read-only so experiment can never accidentally alter raw data
RAW_DATA_ROOT=/home/USER/data/datasets

# processed data root, contains featurized data that can actually be used by a model during experiments
# mounted as read/write, allowing container to save featurized data to host, for re-use with later
# experiments with the same dataset/features/targets.
PROCESSED_DATA_ROOT=/home/USER/data/processed

# for experiments that use transfer learning with VGG16
VGG16_IMAGENET_PATH=/home/USER/models/vgg16
