Container for running mlflow tracking server. 
IMPORTANT: mlflow version MUST be the same as the mlflow version on client machine, otherwise you get VERY difficult to debug server errors when trying to log parameters/metrics/artifacts.

Container contains mlflow, postgres/sqlalchemy engines, google-cloud, and boto3 (aws) for tracking, supporting postgresql tracking db backend, and google/amazon/sftp artifact storage locations.
