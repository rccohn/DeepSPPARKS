cntainer: rccohn/agg-nvdc-v3-base:latest

Image for agg worker docker environment. (GPU VMs on GCP for training/evaluating models for AGG project)

Base image installs:
  - some extra utilities (iptables, ping, netcat)
  - miniconda and relevant libraries (cuda, pytorch geometric, sklearn, etc)

Base image DOES NOT install code for working with spparks data. 
Instead, the deploy image pulls from the base image, and then adds
code from git@github.com:rccohn/AFRL_AGG.git and installs it.

This way, the larger libraries and complex dependencies are solved at the base
image, and the deploy image is easier to modify as code improvements are rolled out.
