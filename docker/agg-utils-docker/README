rccohn/agg-utils-docker-{base,deploy}

"utils" docker image for AGG project
Includes non-GPU libraries

Useful for pre-processing or post-processing/analysis of data
before and after actual model training and inference

base image DOES NOT include AFRL_AGG code so it is easy to rebuild after
updating the code

deploy image simply adds the AFRL_AGG project code on top of the base image.
