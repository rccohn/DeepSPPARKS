Contains files for running gcp cloud sql proxy and mlflow tracking server or ui.
Also contains commands for running docker-compose on gcp container-optimized
OS, which does not have docker-compose (instead, docker-compose itself is run
as a docker container.)

Contains the following
  - docker-compose.yaml:     config file for connection to sql auth proxy
                             and mlflow tracking server (or ui)
  - test_psql.sh:            shell script to verify connection to sql 
                             database
  - compose_as_container.sh: defines "doco" command, which runs
                             docker-compose in a docker container
                             (ie so it can run on gcp COS)
  - run_cos.sh:              shell script to get tracking server up and
                             running on gcp COS in one command.
                             

Needs the following:
 - key file: gcp service account key
 - .env:     env file for docker-compose (and shell scripts) containing 
             secret data (path to service account keys, db login credentials, 
             etc.) The variables are described in the compose file and/or 
             shell scripts that call upon them.
